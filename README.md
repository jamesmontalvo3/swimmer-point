# Generate points list for swim team

## Instructions

1. Sign into active.
2. Open your browser's javascript console (ctrl-shift-j). This script has only been tested in Chrome. It'll probably work in Firefox, Edge, and Safari. It almost definitely won't work in Internet Explorer.
3. Paste the contents of `index.js` into your browser console and hit `ENTER`.
4. For each event you want to include in your sum:
   1. Click the `HOME` tab in the top-left to go to the main view where events are listed.
   2. Find the event in the list, click its "actions" menu, and select "view results by name"
   3. Type `getEventPoints()` into the browser console and hit `ENTER` (after the first time you do this you can just hit the up-arrow to automatically repopulate the console with `getEventPoints()`)
5. Type `sumEvents()` into the console and hit `ENTER`. This will output a CSV format that can be opened in spreadsheet applications.
